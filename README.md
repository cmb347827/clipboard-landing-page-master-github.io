## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap custom overrides
- Bootstrap
- Sass/SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned how to override default Bootstrap breakpoints. I thought it would be very fussy , took a day trying to figure it out because I wanted to avoid downloading Bootstrap.
  But it ended up being very easy. I downloaded the Bootstrap source files folder onto my laptop. I used Ruby and Sass (custom.scss) to override the defaults.
- Also how to add default values to Sass mixins.
- And the use of the CSS backdrop-filter.
- I've also started to use Github desktop to push files to a repository instead of within github.

### Continued development

- Daily tutorials and projects in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, Sass/SCSS. For now, in time I will go re-learn React ect.
